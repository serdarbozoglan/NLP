    "## What is Flash Text?\n",
    "\n",
    "FlashText is a Python library created specifically for the purpose of searching and replacing words in a document. Now, the way FlashText works is that it requires a word or a list of words and a string. The words which FlashText calls keywords are then searched or replaced in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/11/flashtext-a-library-faster-than-regular-expressions/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "String = “spamham sha”\n",
    "Replace “spam” with “eggs” and “sha” with “md5”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s see how does the String look like with and without a single pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "__String = “spamham sha”__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Replace “spam” with “eggs” and “sha” with “md5”__\n",
    "\n",
    "`Single-pass`\n",
    "__String = “eggsham md5”__\n",
    "\n",
    "`Without Single-pass`\n",
    "__String = “eggmd5m md5”__\n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to keep in mind is that checking for a word in the dictionary happens at a character level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use FlashText when you have __to search__ for a large number of keywords, preferably more than 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "FlashText is any day better than regular expressions for __replacing__ keywords in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are still a few caveats of using FlashText. As of now, FlashText does not support partial word matching or special characters matching. For that, Regular Expressions are the best."
